**Document validation using Python (AI)**
  It is used to check a document is valid or not by validating - does the document has signature and all fields are filled. 
  Run the code in colab with the commads placed at the top of main.py
  First upload a document that is not filled and then upload a document that is filled by user
  It returns fields to be filled and fields filled by user as a key value pair
  If a value is empty, then the document is invalid
**Limitations: **
  Valid only for printed text not for handwritten text
  Fields should be in the format -  User filled data above the underline of field to be filled
  Example as shown below:
